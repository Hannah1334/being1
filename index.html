<h1>Detailed Information</h1>
<b>Appearance</b><br>
<i>Humanoid Form:</i> While fairly tall for the average modern female, the Wisp Queen's height does not entirely effect her overall image. Her figure is still very feminine with graciously voloptuous curves, but it is well hidden by her more frail-looking body type. Her skin is almost as pale as her long thick hair that naturally hangs down to her lower back when left alone, and has only a slightly peachy tint to it that is normal for human flesh. Her facial structure is very regal, a sharp jaw and a small chin sets a nice frame, while a small nose and pink lips add a little bit of color to her. The irises of her eyes are only abnormal in the sense that they are such a dull blue they might as well be faded by harsh sunlight.
<br>
<i>Ethereal Form:</i> Technically the Healer remains the same height while in this form, she just floats a couple inches off of the ground making her look taller. The silhouette of her body remains, but rather than flesh and bone she is reduced to merely a thick white fog. While in this form her facial attributes are still present if one looks closely enough and her eyes give off an unnatural glow.
<br><br>
<b>Personality</b><br>
<i>University Mask:</i> X has forced herself to develop quite the ego with the sole intention of using it to make her disliked. Snarky statements at others' expense is very common, and she is quick to throw a tantrum should something set her off. She often seems very cold and distant, and pretends to care very little for the wellbeing of her students.
<br>
<i>True Face:</i> Before the Wisp Queen was ever stuck working for a faceless Headmaster, she was a kind and gentle creature that never raised her voice without good reason. The true X inside the shell of a person she built around her is compassionate toward those in need, always willing to extend a hand and a word of encouragement. She is not, however, incredibly merciful. It takes a lot to set her on a path of vengeance, but if one does, they can expect a nightmare.
</div>

<div id="tab2">
<h1>The Birth of "X"</h1>
In the beginning of existence, even before time itself was a thought, possibilities were endless. Multiple worlds, multiple realities and dimensions, all formed together, all gave birth to life. There were no boundaries, no borders between dimensions, and the lively inhabitants could do as they pleased. Of these inhabitants, three were the most powerful. They were more like a collective of conscious than physical spirits or creatures. They had a wisdom and understanding of existance that far surpassed any living creature. They had names, names in a language that is forever lost to the worlds and beyond human capacity to understand, so currently they may be referred to as Fate, Destiny, and Will.
<br><br>
Will became very ambitious, it wanted to explore the worlds and create a personal connection with the life it found, so it fashioned itself a form to fit the most common shared species among realities; a form we'd call humanistic today. For some time, Will shared it's--now his--wisdom with the life of the realities, but their own ambitions soon corrupted him. He was filled with the desire to control everything, force it to bend to his every word, and began multiplying with all the different kinds of life, creating armies of god-like beings.
<br><br>
Horrified, Fate and Destiny quickly acted to save the worlds. They created borders between dimensions and realities, forcing beings born in a certain world to stay in that world. They trapped Will in one of the many worlds this way, and his armies were scattered across existence with no way to carry on. Just when it seemed peace would finally come, beings who practiced magic started finding ways to bypass the boundaries between worlds, and it didn't take long for Will to learn the trick.
<br><br>
War was no longer avoidable, it was time to create armies of their own. Fate and Destiny worked together to fashion warriors. They created beings to live between worlds in the divides, beings that could actually function and use energy and magic there, live where there is no life, and bring death. These beings were called Will-o'-the-Wisps, and they were designed to follow a commander in their natural order. Together, Fate and Destiny formed what would be the most powerful Wisp, the one who would rule the rest of them. They simply called her "X."
<br><br>
X was immediately put to work, her purpose was ultimately clear. Keep Will's children from passing through the divides, and either kill or bring any they caught before their creators. Their mission was incredibly successful, and it only took a few hundred years for them to successfully eradicate the threat. Of course, they didn't do this alone. During the War, Fate and Destiny felt it very important to give the natural residents of each world a way to defend themselves, so they put little bits of their own power into select seeds, and planted the seeds deep into different areas across the many realms they watched over. Thus, the Magic Trees grew from the soil and provided the people with a way to access their mana pools and cast magic spells.
<br><br>
Once it became clear that Will's offspring were no longer a major threat, X's job changed. Her purpose was now to lead wandering spirits across the divide into a Realm both Fate and Destiny had set aside to be used as a Paradise. She was also their personal servant, acting as a priestess who would take their words to the people they protected as well as taking the words of the people back to the Great Spirits. This continued peacefully for quite some time until greed and ambition took hold of humanity, and they in turn began rebelling and mistreating the gifts from X's Masters. So, angered, the god-like beings formed new beings directly out of the natural materials that made up each Magic Tree, and called these beings Tree Guardians. They were designed to protect the Tree they were made from, but were ordered to wage an entire war against humanity and to wipe out the bloody stain humans left on Fate and Destiny's reputation.
<br><br>
As time passed, the society under X's Masters only grew, until an entire Council had formed beneath them. X was considered one of the highest ranking members of this council, and at her side was a young man by the name of Z. He opened her eyes to how cruel the war against humanity was on both ends and convinced her to commit treason by trying to stop the fighting altogether. As punishment, he was sent to embark on an impossible mission that would hopefully end in his death, and she was exiled from her own home. For most of her sentence, the Wisp has spent her time in the Esmerelda Isles, where she found herself indebted to a man named Ulreich. Now he calls on her to fulfill this debt by becoming the Head Healer at his University that seemed to have just sprung up from nowhere...
<br><br>
And so her life continues.
</div>

<div id="tab3">
<h1>Dimensional Guardians</h1>
Once little pixie-type creatures that were surrounded in bright mana of various colors to make them look like sentient little orbs, the Wisps have grown in power and changed over the thousands of years they've been alive. Of course, it has been the same group of them all through history, since the only Wisp that was designed to reproduce is their Queen. Much like bees in a beehive, all Wisps are strictly loyal to their singular Queen, and will follow any order she may give. Despite being old and wise creatures, most of them are very childish in nature and so they prefer to keep the physical appearance of magic human children. Their Queen, on the other hand, is very adult in both appearance and mindset.
<br><br>
Will-o'-the-Wisps are known to weave paths between realities, much like spiders weaving a web. This allows them to jump from one realm to another with ease, making the job of leading Spirits to the Paradise Realm that much easier. (A strictly Lore based ability that X specifically does not have in Ulreich, but her underlings may.)
</div>

<div id="tab4">
<h1>Epic Medium; Tool for a High Archmage</h1>
<b>The Spirit Stone</b><br>
A crudely cut rectangular crystal looking stone sits in the cold embrace of a dark golden phoenix. The mystic bird is what allows X to wear this pendant as a necklace, and also compliments the pale blue stone as both symbolize the two beings that created her. The Medium itself is a gift directly from them after all. When using the Spirit Stone, it offers a x2 effectiveness buff to her Faith spells (for healing based spells, effectiveness buffs for wards and buffs is only x1.5), and cuts the summon time for her current array of spirits to one post.
<br>
<i>Spirit Stone's Unlocked Ability; The Wisp Queen's Bow</i><br>
<img align="right" style="height:50%;" src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/6c/e1/0a/6ce10ae0c3039e59d492bf6441b6f663.jpg"/>
When channeling mana into the Spirit Stone, X has the option of causing the stone to project an archer's bow. Since this object is only a projection, it cannot be used as a blunt force weapon but it can be used to fire her arrow construct spells. The projection of the bow has to be in physical contact with the hands of the Head Healer in order to remain active, but as long as it is being used if her arrow spells require more than one casting post one of the required posts is knocked off (currently this applies to "Arrows of a Vengeful Spirit" only). 
<br>
The Wisp Queen's Bow naturally gives off enough light to illuminate a ten foot radius around itself in darkness. The glow is dim so it does not harm another being's sight (unless their racials make them specifically sensitive to light).
<br><br>
<h1>Blessed Items</h1>
<b>Breastplate of Righteousness</b><br>
A beautiful and ornate piece of Titanium armor, plated silver with artfully detailed engravings of a tree standing beneath an interlocking sun and moon; also known as the official sigil meant to represent X's Creators. The breastplate itself is large enough to cover the wearer's shoulders, chest, and upper back around the shoulderblades. 
<br>
This Blessed Item is actually two separate pieces that attach to one another in order to form one singular tool, so while they only work together, they do have two separate blessings.
<br>
<i>Heart's Guardian</i><br>
When activated, this blessing allows an aura made from the caster's own mana to protectively surround them and effectively protect against energy based attacks of High Mage or lower. Should the caster use her Archmage mana type rather than her base mana, the aura will also be able to fend against spirit/soul made and based attacks, and fend off up to steel grade physical objects/constructs.
<br>
<i>Spirit's Wings</i><br>
The back piece of the breastplate--which attaches to the front at the shoulders and the sides--can create a separate aura when activated. This one takes on the appearance of folded wings typically seen on art depicting angelic creatures, and in addition to boosting the caster's physical speed and reaction time x2 (cannot stack to be higher than x4), it also allows her to glide through the air for a specified amount of distance or time. The distance being only up to fifty feet, and for only about five posts total. While active, the wings can also be used to manipulate the speed she is gliding through the air, allowing her to hover in one place, or even shoot immediately off in her desired direction (cannot reach speeds over 40 MPH).
</div>

<div id="tab5">
<h1>Racial Abilities</h1>
<b>Passing Days</b><br>
Day and night, sun and moon, no longer affect whether or not X has a physical form or an ethereal form. While her ethereal form is still attainable and still very weak and vulnerable to magic, she can now choose whether she will take on her physical humanoid form or her spiritual one. Her ethereal form is still how she regenerates energy and regains the health she needs to stay alive, so she cannot go without taking this form for long periods of time. 
<br>
<b>Self Healing</b><br>
If X is hurt by natural means ONLY--in other words, is not hurt with magic but gets the flu or is stabbed with a knife by a non-mage human or a non-enchanted weapon--when she changes into her pure energy form at night the injuries and illnesses no longer remain and the next morning her human body is as good as new.
<br>
<b>Mana Sensitivity</b><br>
Wisps are sensitive to other beings who use mana. While they cannot sense specifics, the use of mana in an area can leave behind a detectable imprint allowing them to track much like a dog does with a scent.
<br>
<b>Tireless</b><br>
Wisps do not need sleep to regenerate, just being in their spirit forms allows them to regenerate energy healthily--only as much energy as sleep would regenerate for a human--and do not need to eat unless they are exerting excess energy while in their human forms. 
<br>
<b>Ageless</b><br>
A Wisp chooses which human-equivalent age they wish to stay and stop physically and mentally aging once they reach that point. This is why Wisps are often depicted as children--many wish to stay young and innocent. X herself chooses to remain in her mid to late twenties.
<h1>Universal Spells</h1>
<b>Aura</b><br>
Every living thing has mana, and the colors of their mana and their aura vary from person to person. X's mana is always a very pale blue color, but varies in its shades depending on her mood. <br><i>"Light (sky) blue: peace, serenity, ethereal, spiritual, infinity (The origin of these meanings is the intangible aspects of the sky.)"</i> 
<br><br>
During her time at Ulreich University, X has managed to learn every Universal Spell that has been taught so far (save for "Mana Graft"). To find the descriptions of all these spells, click <a target="_blank" href="https://tyler-fowlow96.wixsite.com/spellbook">this link</a>.
</div>

<div id="tab6">
<h1>Archmage Mana Type: Spiritual Ease</h1>
Now that her natural mana flows through her soul, it retains new qualities in addition to its old ones. While not a physical construct, her raw base mana has a more tangible form. It acts like a cushion, giving some resistance when pressure is applied. When in her ethereal form, especially since that form IS her soul, her mana gives her a more distinguishable shape, and allows her to semi-solidify the substance that makes up her ghostly body. It also still retains the natural healing qualities that come with Faith, meaning that if her natural mana comes in direct contact with a wounded individual, it can start healing minor wounds.
<br><br>
<h1>High Archmage Tree: Shamanism</h1>
<b>Call of the Living</b><br>
Congratulations, X has finally obtained the ability to revive students, now that she can combine aspects of both Faith and Spiritualism together into a whole new Tree! When a student's body is no longer capable of holding its spirit--basically they die--then X can weave her mana into the corpse. This act allows her to read everything she can about the passed on mage's identity, and collect all the information she needs to not only heal the body so it can live again, but also know which spirit in the vast number to call. After summoning the spirit belonging to the body back to where its dead flesh remains and giving it the choice to stay dead or return to life, she will then begin renewing the connection between both entities by healing the body so the spirit may successfully inhabit it once more!
<br>
<b>Diamond Dust</b><br>
Using the special cushiony capabilities of Spiritual Ease as well as the incredible ward-making powers a Faith mage possesses, X can form up to seven smaller basketball sized spheres or two massive ones that can cover a six foot radius. While looking to be made of glass, the walls of these spheres are diamond grade and are actually magical wards that are able to reflect one spell of equal rank unless it's a charged spell (two of one rank below, three of two ranks below, etc.) and even works against spirit-based spells/spiritual beings. The distance the reflected spell can travel back in its original direction of trajectory depends on how powerful the spell is and how far it originally traveled. Spells of equal rank and higher distances won't travel back nearly as far as it originally traveled.
<br>
For an extra cost of mana, X can fill the insides of these spheres with condensed pent up Spiritual Ease so that when they are broken, they burst into ten-foot-radius explosions of pure force, strong enough to break other Titanium grade constructs/objects at point blank range. 
<br>
These orbs can be telepathically controlled within a thirty foot radius of the caster and can reach up to speeds of 100 MPH when shot off like projectiles. Once a Diamond Dust orb is shot like a projectile it cannot be telepathically controlled again unless it lands within the thirty foot radius or the caster approaches it to bring it back within the radius. When shot off, so long as they remain within the radius, they can be stopped and/or telepathically controlled once more.
<br>
<b>Shooting Star</b><br>
When casting this spell, a soft glitter-like substance will fall like rain from ten feet above ground. This "rain" has two modes, the first being a Faith spell. Mages affected by the Faith mode, will have minor wounds quickly healed, and more major wounds if they stay under the spell for long enough time. Mages affected by the Spiritualism mode will be greeted with icy shards of Spirit Force. These shards are cold enough to cause burning of the skin if a mage is under the glitter for long enough. X is not only able to pick and choose which mages within the radius are affected by this spell, but she can also use both modes simultaneously for a much higher mana cost.
<br>
<b>Shaman's Dome</b><br>
A solid barrier that manifests into the shape of a massive dome, capable of stretching up to twenty feet into the air and expanding to cover up to a thirty foot radius around the caster. At its base, the solidified material is diamond grade, but it contains an extra aura-like sheen over its surface that allows it to reflect one attack of equal rank back toward their source of projection at twice the speed they initially traveled (two of one rank lower, three of two ranks lower, anything lesser than High Mage will be reflected continuously). If an extra rotation is spent charging mana over the dome's surface, this reflective quality strengthens, allowing it to instead reflect up to two spells, or one singular charged spell, of equal rank (increases number of lower ranked spells that can be reflected by one as well) but this extra layer only covers one of four major sides of the dome (front/back/left/right) at a time when used, and only one extra layer can be used at once.<br>
When this ability has been used up, the reflective nature will dissipate and leave the highly durable substance underneath exposed. Spells from enemies and allies may pass through the dome undeterred, as long as they are traveling from the inside to the outside (and firing through the side of the orb with the higher reflective power will weaken the accuracy of attacks passed through it).
<br>
<b>Arrows of a Vengeful Spirit</b><br>
A typical two-foot long arrow construct that glows the same soft blue as her mana. This particular spell is a soul-seeking diamond grade arrow that can follow a target for up to ninety feet away from the caster. It takes two posts to form this construct (the first post charges and the second post casts) and once the arrow is shot it can continuously follow a target for up to four rotations (unless the target exceeds the ninety foot radius). Target must be visible to the caster in order for the arrow to lock on. When the arrow manages to collide with a surface the natural cushion-like pressure that the caster's archmage mana type possesses allows it to burst apart into a harsh force-based explosion that has a blast radius of twenty feet. At point blank range this blast is strong enough to shatter Diamond grade constructs and/or materials, but anything further than point blank would have to be at least Tungsten to be broken through.
<br>
<b>Healer's Gentle Touch</b><br>
A powerful spell that allows the caster to completely heal up to two targets within a thirty foot radius of themself. Whether the ailment be natural or magical, even if the damage is done to the soul itself, it will be cured (so long as the damage is of equal or lower rank and she actually does have the ability to heal the ailments). This spell takes one post to charge and one post to cast, and while it can be used to cleanse infections/disperse harmful spells affecting the target it cannot be used to regenerate limbs or bring another being back to life.
<br>
<b>Serenity</b><br>
The caster acts as a spiritual beacon, creating an attractive aura of shining Spirit Force around her body that will draw the attention of her Will-o'-the-Wisps like moths to a flame. She can gather up to four at once in order to use this spell to its full extent, each individual one possesses the same ability on its own.<br>
When a Wisp is summoned and takes its place to complete the spell, it becomes enveloped in an ethereal glow and creates a pillar of luminescent cleansing energy, which stands ten feet tall and measures about two feet wide. Upon reaching completion of its formation (all this happening over the course of a few seconds) the pillar will quickly orbit the caster and slowly spiral outward increasing its radius of effect and distance of travel until it creates a consistent path in a fifty foot radius around her (lasts for five rotations and requires two to cool down before it can be cast again). Each individual pillar is capable of cleansing/dispersing one equal or lesser ranked harmful spell so long as it is in AoE form, and if all four are used at once it has the capacity to cleanse small bits of Corruption (traces within a thirty foot radius of the caster). <br>
Serenity can remove the effect of an AoE spell within a 5 foot radius of the created pillar for as long as it exists; AoE's of Post HM class +2  can be nullified, but only if they have a flat affect and do not charge (Aoe's that gain power over time will break through this cleansing effect for a post + an additional rotation for every rank below you. Projectile spells of physical nature can be deflected by these pillars, being destroyed by constructs of high mage ranking or above, energy spells will be absorbed unless they are of equal power as the caster (hm class2). Mantaining these pillars drain mana over time, and absorbing AoE's and spells will drain even more mana the stronger the opponent. Having multiple active at once is a massive mana drainer. 
<br>
<b>Shaman's Pulse</b><br>
The caster releases a pulse of pure energy into the air that expands out from her body and slowly travels to eventually reach eighty feet away from her (starts at forty for the first rotation, then sixty for the second, stopping at eighty for the third) that only remains present in the air for four rotations before dissipating. The energy itself is harmless but acts as a sensory field, feeding information to the caster's mind directly if any foreign mana signatures are active within its active radius. Whether this be a mage's mana pool, mana in a spell, or mana in artifacts such as mediums or enchanted items, etc, even if they are purposefully being hidden by magic and nonmagic means. However, there are some specific specifications included with the ability to see through magic intending to cloak or hide an individual. The spell can cut through hiding spells made by non deception/psionic mages if their spell is post hm class +1, but class +2 will not be affected. Deception or Psionic mages who have spells meant for anti-sensory (not just hiding) can bypass this with high mage level, and normal hiding illusions will work UNLESS in the caster's ACTUAL line of sight if they are post hm class 1. As it stands, deceptions of class +2 are impossible to break through, but the general area of a mage can be sensed upon their arrival into her field. <br>
A second "option" or "mode" for this spell requires physical contact and for the pulse to be made through that physical contact specifically, into the body of the target. Confining this spell down to be pushed through a body will instead map out its inner workings and show any traces of damage anywhere within their physical existence as well as if there is damage done to their soul and mana pool. The secondary effect is also limited to the rules and mechanics described above for the primary effect (the stuff regarding seeing through magical cloaking).<br>
Requires a two post cooldown after every use, no matter the mode used.

<div id="tab7">
<h1>Primary Tree: Faith</h1>
<i>"Faith mages are a completely support-oriented group of mages. Those who practice Faith hold the ability to mend wounds, lift curses and illnesses, bestow temporary magical boons to their allies, or create Holy Equipment which provide a permanent boon. Faith mages are also highly skilled in defensive arts, and are capable of erecting magical barriers. However, faith mana is completely non hostile, and no faith spell can ever cause harm to another being (unless faith magic specifically harms them)."</i>
<br><br>
<b>Repair</b><br>
A simple spell that allows X to mend any extremity of wounds in any organic substance, whether they be naturally caused or caused by magic (so long as the magic based injury is lower ranking than herself).
<br>
<b>Cleanse</b><br>
A spell that allows X to cleanse infected organic material. Infections that can be cleansed are physical or magical--like deceptions, hexes, and hostile mana--as long as they're the same rank or below her.
<br>
<b>Warrior's Blessing</b><br>
This buff stacks a x1.5 strength increase on the target's natural stats. Can only be active on one mage at a time.
<br>
<b>Athlete's Blessing</b><br>
A buff that stacks a x1.5 endurance increase on the target's natural stats. Can only be active on one mage at a time.
<br>
<b>Renew</b><br>
If an organic substance is missing parts of its original whole body (i.e. a human missing an arm or leg) then this spell allows X to regenerate an entire section of that organic body that is missing. This also goes for internal organic material (such as broken bones being healed/mended).

<b>Tension Reliever</b><br>
If this spell is being cast, a gentle refreshing mist will form, thick enough to cause a slight disruption of sight, but not enough to cause any trouble or confusion. The spell merely acts as a calming agent, loosening tightened muscles, lowering adrenaline levels slightly, and calming nerves. The spell works primarily on the specific person it's being cast on, but if others are present they can be slightly affected by the spell. Any Deception Magic or Curses of equal rank to her or lower will be broken off of whomever this spell is cast on.
<br>
<b>Wall</b><br>
A magic shield of mana that can reflect attacks from mages the same rank as X herself or lower back in the original direction of trajectory. While it can vary in size, the biggest she can possibly make this wall is only seven feet high and five feet wide. (Charged spells of equal rank cannot be reflected, can't reflect consecutive attacks of equal rank, after taking one hit more of the same toughness grade will break through.)

<h1>Secondary Tree: Spiritualism</h1>
<i>"Arguably one of the most powerful trees; Spiritualists possess the ability to speak to and beseech the spirits around themselves. This often requires much time, and also requires the spirits to agree with the mage's cause. One without conviction will not do well within this study. Spiritualists gain access to a unique mana type at Mage rank, which has been deemed "Spirit Force." Spirit Force has the capability to heal the soul, and at some level the flesh as well.​"</i>
<br><br>
<b>Communication</b><br>
The simple ability to see and talk with spirits who do not have tangible forms.
<br>
<b>Summon</b><br>
The ability given to all Spiritualism mages that allows them to summon spirits to aide them.
<br>
<b>Healing Contract</b><br>
X contacts a spirit and asks them to look inside an injured person for her. This spirit can tell her what kind of unseen damage has been done to their organic body. 
<br>
<b>Soul Cleanse</b><br>
Finally X has achieved high enough rank in Spiritualism to experience the wonders of Spirit Force! This spell allows her to cleanse any damage done to sentient things on a spiritual level rather than physical. So long as the cause of the damage was the same rank as her or lower. (This must be done via communicating with spirits and asking them to lend their purifying force. One charge cast up, next post puts spell into effect.) 
<br>
<b>Pulse Diagram</b><br>
This spell allows her to see the internal functions and status of any organic body so long as she weaves her mana through them. (The diagram X recieves in her mind is completely sonar, much akin to giving an ultrasound.) 
<br>
<b>Thermal Redact</b><br>
X makes a request of an ice spirit, if they agree they will very slowly absorb all the thermal energy within a ten foot radius. (One post charge up, second post makes spell effective.) 
<br>
<b>Flash Bang</b><br>
Another request from a spirit, this spirit calls on the power of photokinetics to burst into a bright flash of light that would temporarily blind the average human for about five seconds. 
<br>
<b>Hidden</b><br>
X requests of a spirit to use its powers to hide something within itself, meaning only specific mages of any rank would be able to see what is hidden. (Spiritualists, Necromancers, and any mage one rank higher than X with sensory abilities. First post charges, second post casts. )
